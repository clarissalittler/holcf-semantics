Examples of using Isabelle/HOLCF for modelling simple programming languages.

This repo is going to be for my old experiments and results on using Isabelle/HOLCF to model various typed-lambda-calculi-with-features such as state, IO, non-termination, etc. Most of the meaning functions are done in terms of kleisli arrows. This work isn't really complete and is one of those projects I spent time on but didn't write up. I might try to get all these examples up to date with current Isabelle versions and then write up some kind of tutorial document for if anyone else wants to do formalized modelling of programming languages in Isabelle.
